.IR N ]
.I URL
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B grabsite
function downloads an entire website, including its resources (such as images, CSS, and optionally JavaScript), for offline viewing using
.BR wget .
By default, it mirrors the site up to a maximum depth of 5 levels. The function uses the
.BR -np
option so downloading is restricted only to 
.BR URL
and not to any of its parents.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --no-js
Excludes JavaScript files from the download.
.TP
.BI --depth " N"
Sets the maximum recursion depth to
.I N
levels (default: 5). Use a lower value to download less content or a higher value to download more.

with options that may download significant amounts of data (especially with higher recursion depths). Use lower depths to limit the scope of the download. It also ignores robots.txt restrictions by default, which may violate website policies.
